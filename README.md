## <span style="color: #236fa1;">Build a Webpage Using Your Custom CSS Framework.</span>

You will take everything you've learned and use it to build your own simple grid or fluid framework. This project is kept relatively open-ended to give you a chance to exercise your creativity and problem-solving skills. You may use the create a responsive website exercise as your starting point.

## <span style="color: #236fa1;">Create your custom CSS document.</span>
1. Create a new CSS document.
2. Think about the major elements that are required of a framework. This includes a CSS reset, a fixed number of grids separated by gutters, a way to make new rows, and default values for the font properties of elements.
3. Add CSS media queries for mobile and desktop views.
4. Write the CSS necessary to create a grid or fluid framework.

Check out the [960 Grid System](https://960.gs) and its successor, [Unsemantic](https://unsemantic.com) for a look at how they do a fixed or fluid grid system. Some other tools are: [Responsive Web Design Templates](https://www.w3schools.com/css/css_rwd_templates.asp) and [Material Design Light](https://getmdl.io). Consider using some of these as a starting point.
5. This is your framework ready for the next steps.
